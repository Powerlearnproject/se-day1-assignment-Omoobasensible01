Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

ANSWER: software engeneering is the creation of application with the use of engenering methods and principles amking it more interactive and user friendly

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

ANSWER: 1960S- Introduction of software engeneering as a descipline
        1970s- Introduction of structured programming
        2000s- rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

ANSWER: Requirement- this is the process of gathering information needed to build up a user friendly website
        Design- this mean putting together the structure of how the website will look like
        Implementation- this the processof writing the code according to the design structured by the designer.
        Testing- testing is the process of crosschecking for errors and bugs in the codes written to avoid glitch and malfunction of the software
        Deployment- this is the process of pushing the software out to the user for aceess
        maintainance- maintainance is the act of continuos update of the software, ading or removing particular features to ensure smoothness and easy to use software 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

ANSWER: Software Developer- Software developers are in charge wrting the codes, creating the designed software using codes.
        Quality Assurance Engineer- they create test plans and execute them in other to create a quality website
        Project Manager- project managers work as a supervisor of the creation of a software from the begining till its ready for deployment

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

ANSWER: IDEs is the tools used for the writing, deburging and testing of codes EXP: VISUAL STUDIO
        VCs are used in coordinating among members to search for changes in a sourcecode EXP: GITHUB

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

ANSWER: changing requirement: this is the change in software engineering requirement which may cause a change in the outcome of the the software
        tight schedule: this happenes when a giving time for a particular project is too short, this may lead to rush and causing mistakes in the source code
        technical debt
        STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES
        - Communication
        -Agile methodologies
        -prioritization
        - regular reaccesment of goals and timeline

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

ANSWER: UNIT- testing the modulles one after the other
        Integration- testing the interaction between the components
        System- testing the whole project as a whole
        Acceptance- testing the output to ensure it meets the end user requirement

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

ANSWER: Prompy engineering is the means of creating a specific,understandable and more coincise question to a chatbot in articial intelligence in other to recieve a specific and straight forward response in return from AI models

IMPORTANCE: it heps in giving an understandable and specific response

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

ANSWER: VAGUE PROMPT: Tell me about software development.
        IMPROVED PROMPT:Tell me about software development, specify its importance to the emerging world
        DIFFERENCE: The improved prompt is more effective in the sense that the AI model responds with the advantages and importance of software development to the emerging generations
